        <p>This is part one of a series in reverse engineering binaries provided by <a href="https://www.root-me.org/?page=news&lang=en">root-me.org</a>.  Root-me is a French based
         computer security community that emphasizes hands-on learning.  I highly recommend creating an account for practice. If you are new to the field, you should read their
         Frequently Asked Questions <a href="https://www.root-me.org/?page=faq&lang=en">(FAQ)</a> page for a "learning path."  It includes links to textbooks, research papers, and
       relevant challenges.</p>
