														- Difference between education and certifications
													* Infosec certification "debate" is just a symptom
													* What to look for when choosing a university for infosec
														- Be picky about courses; no "easy A's"
														- Research the University. Do they care about what you learn or do they want your money?
													* Number of certifications indicates a larger industry looking to capitalize on our TIME


													-->


                          <p>&emsp; &emsp;A common thread that persists in #infosec Twitter is the value of certifications. &nbsp;It seems most of
														the community reached a consensus that certifications are not the most important indicator of future job performance. &nbsp;This
														comes as no surprise to those regularly engaged with the community. &nbsp;This post is not meant to debate the point.
														 &nbsp;Instead, this post looks into why the debate arose in the first place and what the education landscape looks like
														 in the U.S. &nbsp;This post will be slightly philosophical as some issues stem from education as a larger entity; not exclusive
														 to information security.
														 <br>
														 &emsp; &emsp; Before rolling into everything, I will begin by stating my general opinion on certifications. &nbsp;Not all certifications are
														 equal. &nbsp;Some are very worthwhile and establish baseline knowledge and can help "get a foot in the door" when looking
														 for first opportunities. &nbsp;Some are basically timesinks that provide little return on investment. &nbsp;Many more
														 certifications lie at various points between the two; like a spectrum of usefulness. &nbsp;Whichever certifications you choose, it
														 is best to go with ones that support whichever infosec jobs you want.

													<h3>&emsp; Information Monopoly</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp;Universities have existed for a few thousand years with the first institutions of higher learning established
															around 2200 BCE. &nbsp;Due to predominant technology, information existed at these institutions in a centralized manner.
															 &nbsp;And for at least half of that time, information was stored, transmitted, and shared orally then by print. &nbsp;Johannes
															 Gutenberg's printing press enabled easier transmission of information across Europe and eventually the New World.
															  &nbsp;Lately electronic media has given rise to mass communications enabling additional information transmission. &nbsp;A
																new distributed manner of education has emerged in the form of online degrees and self-study classes.

																<div class="image post" style="float:right"><img src="../images/education/taking-notes.jpg" width="500" alt=""></div>
															&emsp; &emsp;Decentralization of learning has disrupted traditional education methods. &nbsp;For the vast majority of universities'
															existance, only elites or religious scholars had privilege to attend and access information. &nbsp;This has created an economic impact
															as well since Millennials are the most educated but indebted generation in history. &nbsp;Avocado toast had nothing to do with
															that. &nbsp;The long term effects are not yet known but will likely enable further distributed learning environments.
															 <br>
															 &emsp; &emsp;With mass information transmission in place, a new question arises: what does a formal university education
															provide? &nbsp;Education has become saturated over the past few decades with parents pushing a <i>college-no-matter-what</i> ultimatum
															on high school graduates. &nbsp;
														</p><br>


														<h3>&emsp;Education vs. Credentialing?</h3>
														<p>
															<!-- Education is being treated like a credential; like a 'gate' to pass through. This has diluted the value education is intended
														to provide.  How many times have employers said 'certs are great but what about your real world application?'-->
															&emsp; &emsp;The purpose of higher education is to transmit information in such a way that enables innovation. &nbsp;
													 </p><br>

													<h3>&emsp; Who Should Receive Education?</h3>
														<!-- Everyone should receive education because information is ubiquitious.  This section is more for those wanting to pursue
													Masters or Ph.D degrees in information security fields. -->
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Modularity in system design is great but is it perhaps too high in the sky for engineers of other disciplines? &nbsp;
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE is considered high-level, systems engineers are sometimes required to dig into the true meaning of
															 requirements. &nbsp;Sometimes this is a valid issue as catching mistakes early can save the program money long term. &nbsp;What
															actually happens is tons of time is wasted analyzing "shall" statements in attempts to feign importance to the customer. &nbsp;SE tends
															to breed an environment that rewards overcomplicating tasks to give an appearance that more work is being done than necessary. &nbsp;This of course
															leads into why DODAF contains such an enourmous amount of charts and models; most of which are unnecessary. &nbsp;When is an OV-6 diagram ever
															necessary? &nbsp;Instead, SE should remain	as simple as possible to allow effective communication of project goals. &nbsp;Thankfully this is well
															done in other industry sectors.

														</p><br>


													<h3>&emsp; Not a Key Development Position (KDP)</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; With everything SE offers, why is there a vast age gap in the industry? &nbsp;The median age was upper 40s in most meetings I attended. &nbsp;In
															reality, SE is suitable for engineers who	have spent time developing products earlier in their careers. &nbsp;A cybersecurity engineer
															would make a great systems engineer but	the corollary is not necessarily true; which is funny because I made that exact jump from SE
															to cybersecurity. &nbsp;However, I relied on my masters program when interviewing rather than my SE work. &nbsp;A newly graduated engineer should not be going into SE if a
															business major could execute the same non-technical work such	as action item tracking. &nbsp;From a student's perspective, why attempt
															the rigor of engineering school if a business major can complete the same tasks?
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; In the same vein as KDPs, continuing education recommendations are also disconcerning. &nbsp;Because SE is managerial in nature, higher-ups often
															recommend getting a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) to "check the box" of simply holding a masters degree. &nbsp;Unless the degree is from a top 10
															business school, an MBA is basically worthless; but that topic is an entire post of its own. &nbsp;If you are an engineer who enjoys learning and
															 discovering how systems, computers, applied mathematics, or general natural environments work, this attitude	is particularly alarming. &nbsp;This is
															  not the approach to continuing education that management should	emphasize. &nbsp;PhD holders are unicorns in SE environments. &nbsp;Although they
																preach the values of post-graduate studies, management is extremely reluctant to pay for continuing education if they cannot use your future credentials to bid on
															 work. &nbsp;Peers have told me they had to jump through hoops for an employer to reimburse PhD courses. &nbsp;"Why get a PhD?" &nbsp;Publication and mastery of
															 your field are apparently not enough. &nbsp;For this reason alone, full-time SE sectors perpetuate anti-intellectual behavior in an ironic attempt to
															 support masters degrees and continuing education.
															<br>

														 &emsp; &emsp; Even though SE bills itself as interdisciplinary, the work itself is one-dimensional. &nbsp;A systems engineer does not directly develop the system solutions
														  nor do they perform the actual integration of said solutions. &nbsp;This means dedicated SE is a dead-end job in which lateral
														 movement to other engineering fields are greatly hindered. &nbsp;If the company structure is top-down with many levels of management, the effect is worsened and
														 if the systems engineer happens to be in middle-management, they are essentially shoehorned to be a systems engineer for life. At that point, you better love your job
														 because you are stuck! &nbsp;In contrast, a software engineer learns about development, OSs, programming languages, data structures, and various technical aspects
														 that plug into other engineering fields. &nbsp;Unless career trajectory involves management, SE practitioners often lack the freedom of maneuver of other
														 disciplines. &nbsp;I recommend limiting dedicated SE jobs to two years if other engineering fields sound appealing and avoid entry/junior SE positions at all costs.
														</p><br>

														<h3>&emsp; More Meetings</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; I have witnessed various <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23infosec&src=typed_query" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">#InfoSec</a>
															personalities on Twitter state how much they loathe meetings; sometimes going	into great detail. &nbsp;They will use Slack, email,
															and phone calls to ensure pointless meetings are non-existent. &nbsp;To them, meetings on their calendars are present for a legitimate
															 reason; however, this is not necessarily the case for SE.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Depending on the industry, deliverables are determined by meetings and documents reviewed rather than producing
															the system itself. &nbsp;Programs often have Preliminary Design Reviews (PDRs), Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), and Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs)
															to determine program direction and effectiveness. &nbsp;These are understandably long meetings which require input and participation from all parties. &nbsp;Then
															there are smaller meetings leading up to the big meetings. &nbsp;Most are tag-ups to gauge progress or work on requirements/specifications matrices. &nbsp;In
															reality the vast majority of small meetings are unnecessary busy work designed to get "face-time" with customers and project members. &nbsp;They
															are based on archaic principles left over from the corporate world to which older employees are accustomed. &nbsp;To that end, SE is not a traditionally flexible
															engineering discipline and lacks forward-looking innovative measures, which is harmful in the long run as it becomes difficult to
															recruit Millennial and Generation-Z engineers.
														</p><br>

													<h3>&emsp; "Butts-in-Seats"</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE contains valid work, some business sectors are inundated with systems engineers to an unnecessary degree. &nbsp;This
															plethora causes a depression in the worth of their work. &nbsp;There are only so many engineers that can be thrown at a requirements
															document before waste occurs. &nbsp;It never occurs to managers, stakeholders, or even system owners how much money, time, and effort is wasted at
															various levels.
														</p>
														<p>
															<div class="image post" style="float:left"><img src="../images/SE-3/butt_in_seat.png" width="300" alt=""></div>
													  	&emsp; &emsp; This depression causes tons of downtime and ultimately boredom for more ambitious employees. &nbsp;As previously mentioned,
															 overcomplication of menial tasks gives an appearance of "productivity;" productivity that is unsolicited. &nbsp;Appearance is the bottom line. &nbsp;Over
															 time this becomes exhausting, especially in an office full of inflated egos. &nbsp;Acronyms are a great example of appearance inflation. &nbsp;Most of
															 the time they are legitimate and useful for quickly communicating types of systems, sub-systems, parts, and concepts. &nbsp;In the SE world, acronyms
															 act as a second language and are sometimes made up. &nbsp;I encountered one systems engineer who regularly created two letter acronyms for his chart
															  packages.	&nbsp;Why would someone do that? &nbsp;More work is required to track new acronyms and communicate shared understanding to stakeholders. &nbsp;It ties
																back to appearance of effort. &nbsp;Just throw three letters together and think of a name so everyone gets the impression that engineers are conducting
																"business." &nbsp;Acronym abuse is rampant and ultimately wasteful.
															 <br>
															 &emsp; &emsp; Depending on the company, SE is very prone to "body shop" type of work. &nbsp;This is usually another outcome of depression
															 caused by too many systems engineers. &nbsp;I have heard from friends and coworkers about jobs in which they were left alone for upwards of
															 three months at a time! &nbsp;One coworker coined this as "butts-in-seats" type of work where people are hired to fill a contract. &nbsp;Unsurprisingly
															 these are usually SE positions.

														</p><br>


														<h2>&emsp; Analysis</h2>
															<p>
																&emsp; &emsp; SE is a discipline that contains incredibly useful principles that should be applied to every engineering
																field. &nbsp;At a high level, SE is great for organization and identifying problems and pitfalls in projects. &nbsp;Remember to use it as a "pinch of salt"
																to avoid burdening the project.
																<br>
																&emsp; &emsp; Limitations of SE should be considered at the small team level, although a small team will likely never reach them. &nbsp;Additionally, I
																consider stand-alone systems engineers as	engineering generalists; meaning their work is ultimately overhead for actual engineering teams. &nbsp;If
																considering an SE position, the following questions need addressing before the interview:

																	<ol type="1">
																		<li>Are you at least a mid-level engineer?</li>
																		<li>Do you want to be management?</li>
																		<li>Do you enjoy meetings?</li>
																	  <li>How long do you wish to stay a systems engineer?</li>
																	  <li>Do you have a plan for graduate school?</li>
																		<li>Do the Project Management Professional (PMP) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certifications excite you?</li>
																	</ol>

																If any responses to these questions are in doubt, SE is likely not for you. &nbsp;Some technology companies have specialized SE
																positions that retain technical proficiency, but these are exceptions. &nbsp;Overall SE principles are fantastic and worth using in projects. &nbsp;There is a reason
																systems-based approaches have permeated engineering fields. &nbsp;On the contrary, I advise against a dedicated SE career as it will likely bore you to tears. &nbsp;Work
																instead in specialized areas	while incorporating SE's valuable components a la carte.
