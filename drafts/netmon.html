                          <p>&emsp; &emsp; Good evening Jim, today's HTB writeup is on "Netmon." &nbsp;This machine is rated very easy
														but that was only for the user flag. &nbsp;The root flag required more effort and enumeration. &nbsp;It was very heavy on CVEs and realistic according to machine
														statistics. &nbsp;I ran into trouble due to the exploit requiring certain credentials, which were tricky to find. &nbsp;A remediation section is included on how
														to fix weaknesses.

													 <p>
														 &emsp; &emsp;First step is launching the initial and OS nmap scans on the target IP. &nbsp;Results show several open ports including traditionally vulnerable ports such as FTP and SMB.
														  &nbsp;OS scan results show leaked port information for ports 21 and 80. &nbsp;According to the second scan, Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or 2012 is the most likely OS with high confidence.

							<br><section id="FTP"><h2>Anonymous FTP</h2></section>

					 									<p>
					 									&emsp; &emsp;Port 21 was open so I decided to begin port enumeration there. &nbsp;Since the machine allows anonymous FTP login, I did just that with username/password both
														set to 'anonymous'.
					 									</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/3-anon-ftp.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

														<p>
															I noticed the folder <i>C:\Users</i> was displayed so I tried to see how far I could push into the system. &nbsp;Access to the <i>Administrator</i> folder was not
															authorized so I checked out <i>Public</i>. &nbsp;Flag file <i>user.txt</i> was found!
														</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/4-cd-users.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

														<p>
															I fumbled with FTP commands a bit but was able to pull the flag to my Kali <i>/root</i> directory and dump its contents! &nbsp;User own took about 30 seconds so I rated it
															difficulty 0/10 but HTB doesn't allow that; 1/10 was what I submitted.

								<br><section id="Further"><h2>Further Enumeration</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;After pulling down the user flag, I began looking for exploits and CVEs related to PRTG Network Monitor. &nbsp;I navigated to <i>10.10.10.152</i> in Firefox and poked around
													a bit. &nbsp;It has a login prompt on its welcome page but nothing out of the ordinary. &nbsp;I found an <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46527" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">RCE exploit</a>
													while googling and noticed default credentials.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/7-script-creds.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													I made an attempt with the default credentials but no luck. &nbsp;I also ran the exploit with cookies from the login page but it output a "success" message with credentials that didn't work. &nbsp;I
													continued looking for exploits related to PRTG. &nbsp;I ran the credentials through ftp and smbclient but received the same bad password messages.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/8-default-fail.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												While searching for Indy http exploits, I came across <a href="https://www.criticalstart.com/prtg-network-monitor-privilege-escalation/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">this link</a> which lists files
												containing useful information. &nbsp;I did not see the folder <i>ProgramData</i> in my earlier ftp connection so I suspected the folder was hidden. &nbsp;I fired up ftp and attempted to change into that
												directory. &nbsp;It exists!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/9-hidden-folder.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													I moved to the target files and retrieved them with the <i>get</i> command.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/10-config-files.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												The ensuing enumeration was time consuming but I ran into a username/password pair in plaintext! &nbsp;It was located in <i>PRTG Configuration.old.bak</i> at lines 140-143 with <i>dbpassword</i> tags.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/11-dbpassword.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Entry"><h2>Initial Entry</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;I tried logging into the web interface with the dbpassword credentials but they failed. &nbsp;I repeated this for ftp and smb but also got no luck. &nbsp;What was wrong with the password?
													 &nbsp;It took some thought but I noticed a couple of clues: 1) I found out the machine was deployed to HTB in 2019 but the password said '2018'. 2) The configuration file containing
													 dbpassword had a <i>.old</i> file extension. &nbsp;With those hints in mind, I increased the year to <i>2019</i> and had a successful login!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/12-login-success.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Exploit"><h2>Exploitation</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;I messed around with the PRTG Network Monitor system hoping to find cookies to use in my earlier script. &nbsp;I spent the better part of 2 hours trying to find cookies in the web
													interface because I didn't see the <i>"Inspect"</i> option when I right-clicked the page. &nbsp;Eventually I just clicked the "hamburger" icon and selected <i>Web Developer > Web Console</i> to access
													the exact cookies I need!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/13-credentialed-cookies.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													I plugged the values into the script for a successful run. &nbsp;This time the script takes longer to output the exploit message; indicating that it worked!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/14-prtg-command.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													To see if the exploit worked, I tried the new credentials on ftp and smb. &nbsp;I already had access to the admin panel of PRTG so that was not my concern. &nbsp;FTP did not work so I used the
													credentials in <i>smbclient</i>.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/15-smbdump.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													The list of share drives was able to print. &nbsp;I was unable to do this before so I made an attempt on the ADMIN$ drive. &nbsp;It was successful!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/16-smbadmin.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Post"><h2>Post-Exploitation</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;After gaining access to the ADMIN$ drive, I began poking around to find interesting files and folders. &nbsp;Although folders like <i>System32</i> are interesting and contain valuable
													information, they do not contain what I am looking for. &nbsp;I exited the ADMIN$ drive and successfully entered the C$ drive to find the filesystem I expected.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/17-smbC.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													I navigated to the Administrator's Desktop and pulled down <i>root.txt</i>
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/18-get-root.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													Finally I dumped <i>root.txt</i> and entered the flag into HTB! \o/
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/19-root-flag.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Remediation"><h2>Remediation</h2></section>

												<p>
												&emsp; &emsp;Unlike previous machines, this server did not use default credentials for its interfaces. &nbsp;It was a step up from machines like <i>Nibbles</i> and <i>Jerry</i>. &nbsp;This machine's Achilles' heel was leaving
												old config files on the system and allowing anonymous access to them. &nbsp;Old logs such as "PRTG Configuration.old" should be relocated to secure areas, have sensitive credentials removed/encrypted, or even purged.<br>

												&emsp; &emsp;The vulnerability used to gain foothold in the PRTG Network Monitor interface was weak password reuse. &nbsp;Not only was the password not strong enough, it was susceptible to recycling. &nbsp;Anyone able to
												add a number or slightly modify the password can significantly reduce the number of tries needed to gain entry. &nbsp;A stronger password policy will fix that.
												&emsp; &emsp;Anonymous ftp must also be disabled. &nbsp;This can be done by following
												<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.applicationhost/sites/site/ftpserver/security/authentication/anonymousauthentication" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">these</a> instructions:
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/20-disable-ftp.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												In addition to disabling services, banner responses should be disabled to hinder reconaissance. &nbsp;For HTTP this can be disabled at the server by modifying the <i>DisableServerHeader</i> registry key and setting its
												value to 1. &nbsp;Additional response instructions can be found in <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/iis-support-blog/remove-unwanted-http-response-headers/ba-p/369710" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">this blog post</a>.
												 &nbsp;Disabling ftp response headers is similar but not critical since the ftpd version number isn't leaked. &nbsp;Since the target machine is Server 2008, the default banner can be suppressed by a simple check box. &nbsp;
												 Instructions can be found <a href="https://www.ehow.co.uk/how_7532329_change-font-used-smarterm.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">here</a>.<br>
												 &emsp; &emsp;Finally, the RCE vulnerability (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9276" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">CVE-2018-9276</a>) enabled us to add an Administrator account allowing us to
												 remote into the machine via smbclient. &nbsp;The obvious remediation is to upgrade to PRTG version >= 18.2.39 &nbsp;This patch was released on April 20, 2018 according to the vulnerability
												 <a href="https://www.codewatch.org/blog/?p=453" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">source</a>. &nbsp;The first mistake pointed out by the article is PRTG running as <i>Local System</i> by
												default allowing any command injections to run with those high level privileges. &nbsp;This attribute must be changed whenever PRTG Network Monitor is installed. &nbsp;The most significant weakness
												of the RCE vulnerability is the lack of checks on special characters or length.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/21-powershell.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													The powershell script above from <i>CodeWatch</i> should contain code allowing only expected characters to be in <i>$Args[0]</i>. &nbsp;Input validation needs to occur after <i>$Path</i> is assigned and before the
													if-statement. &nbsp;It could be something like this by Ed Wilson from Microsoft
													 <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/weekend-scripter-remove-non-alphabetic-characters-from-string/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">devblogs</a>:<br>
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/netmon/22-sanitize.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													The above powershell would replace any non-alphabetic input with spaces. &nbsp;It needs tweaking since spaces are likely not the best choice, but it's a start in the right direction. &nbsp;An additional
													option is to check for length if the parameter has that requirement. &nbsp;It's just another hurdle for malicious input.
												</p>


								<br><section id="Thoughts"><h2>Thoughts</h2></section>
												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;<i>Netmon</i> is a fantastic box for learning the importance of enumeration. &nbsp;The ease of overlooking critical log files cannot be overstated. &nbsp;Whenever the next exploitation
													step is reached, you should inspect all encountered files for revealing information. &nbsp;I have noticed it is often seemingly random files that contain information related to the next step. &nbsp;
													Overall I rate this box a 4/10 difficulty due overcoming the "correct dbpassword." &nbsp;I also submitted separate ratings for each flag; user
													flag is 0/10 (or 1/10) while root receives a significantly higher score of 4/10.
