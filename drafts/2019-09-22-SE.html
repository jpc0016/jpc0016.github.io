                        <h2>&emsp; On Systems Engineering</h2>
                        <div class="box">
                          <p>&emsp; &emsp; Good evening Tim and Aaron!  I was on hiatus due to school and spent copious amounts of time wondering how Auburn
														STUNNED Oregon with twenty seconds left in the fourth quarter.  This post will cover the pros and cons of
														Systems Engineering (SE) and how to effectively use the development process.  A colleague once said SE is like salt; a
														little bit is great, but too much can be problematic.  This is admittedly a bit paraphrased but holds true across
														companies and industry sectors.	 While useful in determining problems and brainstorming solutions, SE has limitations
														beyond early phases.  Having spent a few years in the SE world, I will communicate its overall effectiveness.
													</p>

													<h3>&emsp; The Big Picture</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; As Wikipedia's definition entails, SE is "an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on
															how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles."  SE focuses on the overarching design of products
															and engineering solutions.  At its core, SE is management encapsulated by various engineering professions; which allows great visibility
															into a system's big picture.  The most common SE approach is the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which frequently appears in various Information Technology
															 (IT) certifications.  A simplified life-cycle approach is below.  The "V-model" from The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)
															 is much more detailed.
															<div class="image post" style="float:right"><img src="../images/SE/1024px-Systems_Engineering_Process_II.svg.png" width="700" alt=""></div><br>
															This is ultimately the process of designing a product.  A smart person has an idea, writes it down, but needs guidance on how to proceed.  "What
															is the next step?"  Referring to a concrete model simplifies the development process and causes less frustration in the beginning.  In
															software engineering, a developer does not code their entire project all at once.  That is usually too difficult for a significant project.
															Instead software engineers incrementally write and test the project to ensure its building blocks work.  The development process, much
															like the system life cycle process, is a methodical journey with validation ensured.

														</p>




														<!--Systems engineering experience helps you break down big problems-->
													<h3>&emsp; Breaking Down Problems</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; As stated above, SE deals with problems of scale requiring many calculated steps.

															discipline primarily focuses on overarching design of products.
														</p>

														<!-- CONS-->

														<!--Too high level to be considered engineering.  No engineering degree needed to do actual work
															It also overly complicates tasks to give an appearance that more work is being done than what is required-->
													<h3>&emsp; Too High Level?</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Modularity in system design is great but is it perhaps too high in the sky for engineers of other disciplines?  There is
															a reason SE contains "management" so prominently in its definition; because it IS a management-based engineering discipline.

															They LOVE their acronyms.
														</p>


														<!--Not a key developmental position for young engineers-->
													<h3>&emsp; Key Development Position</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; With everything SE offers, why is there a vast age gap in the industry?
														</p>


														<!--Meetings tend to be the product, not the system itself-->
														<h3>&emsp; More Meetings</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; I have witnessed various #InfoSec personalities on Twitter state how much they loathe meetings; sometimes going
															into great detail.  They will use Slack, email, and phone to ensure pointless meetings are non-existent.  To
															them, meetings on their calendars are present for a legitimate reason; however, this is not necessarily the case for
															SE.
														</p>
														<p>
															Depending on the industry, the focus and deliverables focus on meetings and documents than on producing the system itself.  As previously mentioned,
															strong documentation skills can separate an engineer from the pack.
														</p>


														<!--More prone to "butts in seats" work-->
													<h3>&emsp; "Butts in Seats"</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE is a valid engineering field, certain industries are inundated with systems engineers to an unnecessary degree.
															This plethora causes a depression in the worth of their work.  There are only so many engineers that can be thrown at a requirements
															document before waste occurs.  It never occurs to managers or even system owners how much money, time, and effort is wasted at
															various levels.
														</p>
														<p>
															<div class="image post" style="float:left"><img src="../images/SE/butt_in_seat.png" width="300" alt=""></div>
													  	This depression causes tons of downtime and ultimately boredom for more ambitious employees.  Very prone to body shop type of work.
														</p>

														<h2>&emsp; Analysis</h2>
															<p>
																&emsp; &emsp; There are relevant questions that need to be addressed before working as a systems engineer:

																<ol type="1">
  																<li>Why</li>
																  <li>What</li>
																	<li>How</li>
																</ol>
															</p>
