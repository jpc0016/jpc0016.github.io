                        <div class="box">
                          <p>&emsp; &emsp; Good evening Tim and Aaron!  I was on hiatus due to school and spent copious amounts of time wondering how Auburn
														STUNNED Oregon with twenty seconds left in the fourth quarter.  This post will cover the pros and cons of
														Systems Engineering (SE) and how to effectively use the development process.  A colleague once said SE is like salt; a
														little bit is great, but too much can be problematic.  This is admittedly a bit paraphrased but holds true across
														companies and industry sectors.	 While useful in determining problems and brainstorming solutions, SE has limitations
														beyond early phases.  Having spent a few years in the SE world, I will communicate its overall effectiveness.
													</p>

													<h3>&emsp; The Big Picture</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; As Wikipedia's definition entails, SE is "an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on
															how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles."  SE focuses on the overarching design of products
															and engineering solutions.  At its core, SE is management encapsulated by various engineering professions; which allows great visibility
															into a system's big picture.  The most common SE approach is the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which frequently appears in various Information Technology
															 (IT) certifications.  A simplified life-cycle approach is below.  The "V-model" from The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)
															 is much more detailed.
															<div class="image post" style="float:right"><img src="../images/SE/1024px-Systems_Engineering_Process_II.svg.png" width="700" alt=""></div>
															This is ultimately the process of designing a product.  A smart person has an idea, writes it down, but needs guidance on how to proceed.  "What
															is the next step?"  Referring to a concrete model simplifies the development process and causes less frustration in the beginning.  In
															software engineering for example, a developer does not code their entire project all at once.  That is usually too difficult for significant projects.
															Instead software engineers incrementally write and test the project to ensure its building blocks work.  The development process, much
															like the system life cycle process, is a methodical journey with validation ensured.

														Discuss requirements here.-->
													<h3>&emsp; Breaking Down Problems</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; As stated above, SE deals with problems of scale requiring many calculated steps.  Trying to conquer everything at
															once leads to disorganization, frustration, and ultimately lack of results.  Like software engineering, SE involves breaking
															big problems into little problems.  Some refer to this as a "modular approach" to engineering, since a system is subdivided
															into managable building blocks.  This does not always happen easily and requires deliberate planning.  For example,
															suppose you are to design a corporate network spanning multiple sites.  One approach is to examine multiple factors such as
															budget, required services, and backup plans to develop a list of requirements.  These requirements can span multiple levels of
															the system and often have sub-requirements.  Ultimately this boils down to input requirements satisfying a higher level
															requirement.  Much like the linear signals and systems diagram below, system design and requirements analysis behaves the same way
															by evaluating inputs (<i>x</i>) to the system (<i>h(x)</i>) and analyzing the output produced (<i>y(x)</i>).

															<!-- Block Diagram example goes here-->
															<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/SE/block-diagram.png" width="500" alt=""></div></center><br>

															This is the ultimate goal of SE; to create the simplest model of a system without neglecting critical details.  Real life
															systems will obviously never be like the diagram above.  More intricate flowcharts are used and can differ slightly between
															system components.  What matters is the appropriate level of detail is present to effectively depict system inputs and outputs.
															<br>
															The highest levels of context are	expressed as Operation Viewpoint charts (usually OV-1).  According to the Department of Defense
															 Architecture Framework (DODAF), there are many more sub-models and charts used to depict system architecture; however, using
															 them all is typically overkill.  There is no need to get bogged down in unnecessary details so the system architect
															 determines which information is relevant to present in OV charts.  The beauty of DODAF is its comprehensiveness and breakdown
															 of which data goes where.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Using SE techniques in a small engineering team is great to help with visualization.  For a small team,
															 techniques beyond basic flowchart and requirements definition steps is useless.  This is because SE is considered overhead for
															 this type of team executing the actual work.  As long as project goals are broken down into incremental steps and phases, an
															  engineering team will be successful.  Another major upside to SE is developing strong documentation skills.  These skills are
																tied to writing skills, which are often lacking in other engineering fields.  Software engineering has been particularly
															vocal about this shortcoming.  Therefore, strong documentation skills will make an engineer stand out among their peers.
															<!--Strong documentation skills can separate an engineer from the pack. -->

														</p>

														<!-- CONS-->

														<!--Too high level to be considered engineering.  No engineering degree needed to do actual work
															In contrast, SE also overly complicates tasks to give an appearance that more work is being done than what is required.
														Mention OV-1 charts here-->
													<h3>&emsp; Too High Level?</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Modularity in system design is great but is it perhaps too high in the sky for engineers of other disciplines?  There is
															a reason SE contains "management" so prominently in its definition; because it IS a management-based engineering discipline.  Certain
															industries do not require engineering degrees for systems engineers.  This infers SE work can be done by non-technical majors and
															is more appropriate for business school graduates.  When reviewing actual SE work, this assumption holds true.  What tools do
															systems engineers use?  Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook are the most common tools.  Sometimes Microsoft Visio is included
															when designing flowcharts.  IT systems engineers will [hopefully] use Linux Operating Systems (OSs), Wireshark, command line tools, and
															 maybe PowerShell; however, these people are the exceptions.  I entered exactly zero linux commands during my systems engineering tenure.
															Microsoft Office suite reigned supreme.  No engineering degree was necessary to fulfill my job duties.<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE is considered high-level, systems engineers are sometimes required to dig into the true meaning of
															 requirements.  Sometimes this is a valid issue as catching mistakes early can save the program money in the long run.  What
															actually happens is tons of time is wasted analyzing "shall" statements in attempts to show importance to the customer.  SE tends
															to breed an environment that rewards overcomplicating tasks to give an appearance that more work is being done than necessary.
														</p>


														<!--Not a key developmental position for young engineers-->
													<h3>&emsp; Not a Key Development Position</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; With everything SE offers, why is there a vast age gap in the industry?  The reality is SE is for engineers who
															have spent time developing products earlier in their careers.  A cybersecurity engineer would make a great systems engineer but
															the corollary is not necessarily true; which is funny because I made that exact jump from SE to cybersecurity.  However, I relied
															on my masters program when interviewing rather than my SE work.  A newly graduated engineer should not be going into SE if a
															business major could execute the same non-technical work such	as action item tracking.  To a young engineer, what is the point of
															going through engineering school if a business major can complete the same tasks?
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Continuing education recommendations are also disconcerning.  Because SE is managerial in nature, higher-ups often
															recommend getting a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) to "check the box."  Unless it's from a top 10 business school, an MBA
															 is basically worthless; but that topic is an entire blog post of its own.  If you are an engineer who enjoys learning and
															 discovering how things work, this attitude	is particularly alarming.  This is not the approach to continuing education that should
															 ever come from management.  PhD holders are unicorns in SE environments.  Although they preach the values of post-graduate
															 studies, management is extremely reluctant to pay for continuing education if they cannot use your future credentials to bid on
															 contracts.  Peers have told me they had to jump through hoops for an employer to reimburse PhD courses.
														</p>


														<!--Meetings tend to be the product, not the system itself-->
														<h3>&emsp; More Meetings</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; I have witnessed various <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23infosec&src=typed_query" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">#InfoSec</a>
															personalities on Twitter state how much they loathe meetings; sometimes going	into great detail.  They will use Slack, email,
															and phone calls to ensure pointless meetings are non-existent.  To them, meetings on their calendars are present for a legitimate
															 reason; however, this is not necessarily the case for SE.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Depending on the industry, deliverables are determined by meetings and documents reviewed rather than producing
															the system itself.
														</p>


														<!--More prone to "butts in seats" work-->
													<h3>&emsp; "Butts-in-Seats"</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE is a valid engineering field, certain industries are inundated with systems engineers to an unnecessary degree.
															This plethora causes a depression in the worth of their work.  There are only so many engineers that can be thrown at a requirements
															document before waste occurs.  It never occurs to managers, stakeholders, or even system owners how much money, time, and effort is wasted at
															various levels.
														</p>
														<p>
															<div class="image post" style="float:left"><img src="../images/SE/butt_in_seat.png" width="300" alt=""></div>
													  	&emsp; &emsp; This depression causes tons of downtime and ultimately boredom for more ambitious employees.  As previously mentioned,
															 overcomplication of menial tasks gives an appearance of "productivity;" productivity that is unsolicited.  Appearance is the bottom line.
															 Over time this becomes exhausting, especially in an office full of inflated egos.  Acronyms are a second language and are sometimes made
															 up.  I encountered one systems engineer who regularly made up two letter acronyms in his chart packages.  Why would anyone do that??
															 <br>
															 &emsp; &emsp; Depending on the company, SE is very prone to "body shop" type of work.  This is usually another outcome of the depression
															 caused from too many systems engineers.  I have heard from friends and coworkers about jobs in which they were left alone for upwards of
															 three months at a time!!  One coworker coined this as "butts-in-seats" type of work where people are hired just to fill a contract.  Unsurprisingly
															 these are usually SE positions.
														</p>

														<h2>&emsp; Analysis</h2>
															<p>
																&emsp; &emsp; SE is a discipline that contains some incredibly useful aspects.  These are qualities that should be applied to every engineering
																field.  Limitations of SE should be considered at the small team level.  Additionally, I consider stand-alone systems engineers to be
																engineering generalists; meaning their work is ultimately overhead for actual engineering teams.  If considering an SE position,
																 the following questions need to be addressed before interviewing:


																	<ol type="1">
																		<li>Are you at least a mid-level engineer?</li>
																		<li>Do you want to be management?</li>
																		<li>Do you enjoy meetings?</li>
																	  <li>How much do you enjoy Microsoft Office products?</li>
																	  <li>Do you have a plan for graduate school?</li>
																		<li>Do the Project Management Professional (PMP) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certifications excite you?</li>
																	</ol>

																If any responses to these questions are in doubt, SE is likely not for you.  Some technology companies may have specialized SE
																positions retain some semblance of technical proficiency, but these are the exception.
