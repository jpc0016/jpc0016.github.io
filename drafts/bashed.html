                          <p>&emsp; &emsp; Good evening Tim and Aaron, today's HTB writeup is on "Bashed." &nbsp;This machine has mostly 3/10 ratings
														so it was not too difficult. &nbsp;I ran into trouble due to exploits requiring certain credentials, which were tricky to find. &nbsp;A significant
														amount of time was also spent using the correct payload. &nbsp;Just like last time, a remediation section is included on how to implement fixes.
                           </p>

								<br><section id="Enumeration"><h2>Initial Enumeration</h2></section>
													 <p>
														 &emsp; &emsp;As usual launch the initial and OS nmap scans on the target IP. &nbsp;Results show only port 80 is open with <i>Apache httpd 2.4.18</i> as its running service. &nbsp;OS
														 scan results show leaked header information and the site's title: <i>Arrexel's Development Site</i>. &nbsp;This is simply the name of the HTB user who created the machine. &nbsp;
														 According to port enumeration, Ubuntu is the most likely flavor of Linux at version 3.xx. &nbsp;The exact version will be confirmed later. &nbsp;Once again, header and service
														  information disclosure is a no-go.

							<br><section id="Apache"><h2>Apache httpd</h2></section>

					 									<p>
					 									&emsp; &emsp;With port 80 open on a TCP scan, it was the obvious starting point for deeper enumeration. &nbsp;Step one is to test the machine on a web browser by navigating to
														<i>https://10.10.10.68/</i> in Firefox. &nbsp;The result was a home page with options for clicking! &nbsp;I clicked around and found the <i>/single.html</i> page with a clue.
					 									</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/3-homepage.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

														<p>
															The site developer is essentially admitting they integrated a bash interface to their website. &nbsp;An alternative line of thought is the author made it easy to invoke their
															shell on this site. &nbsp;Either way this is good for red team!
														</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/4-phpbash.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

														<p>
															Run <i>dirbuster</i> on the root folder with a medium directory wordlist. &nbsp;Ensure at least php is in the <i>File extension</i> field.
					 									</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/5-dirbuster.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

														<p>
															Results will appear and an interesting folder stands out: <i>/dev/</i>. &nbsp;This folder holds <i>phpbash.php</i> which matches what is seen in <i>Arrexel's</i> github page.
					 									</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/6-dirbuster-phpbash.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

														<p>
														Right click the shell and select <i>Open In Browser</i>. &nbsp;A php bash shell implementation is invoked with low level privileges!
					 									</p>
					 									<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/7-shell-access.png" alt="" /></div></center><br><br>



								<br><section id="Filesystem"><h2>Filesystem Inspection</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;Once the shell is received, the first step is to inspect contents of the file system to check what can be accessed. &nbsp;Navigate to the root directory to find the standard Linux
													filesystem.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/8-navigate-root.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													So far so good. &nbsp;Check for users in <i>/home/</i>. &nbsp;It appears <i>Arrexel</i> left a user account on the system. &nbsp;Check in their directory to find the user flag and dump it!
												</p>

												<p>
												While <i>dirbuster</i> was at work, I grabbed backend system information with <i>wappalyzer</i> then inspected the <i>README</i> once it was revealed. &nbsp;The <i>README</i> was interesting in
												that it implied <i>nibbleblog</i> was an actual blogging framework, not a random name someone gave to their blog. &nbsp;This was noted by "Nibbleblog Version: v4.0.3" in the red square. &nbsp;The
												nibbleblog documentation sites also gave it away.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/10-wappalyzer.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/11-nibbleblog-version.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												<i>dirbuster</i> eventually revealed a page called <i>admin.php</i>. &nbsp;This looked interesting so I navigated to the page for inspection. &nbsp;A login page was shown!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/12-login-page.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Entry"><h2>Initial Entry</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;I tried basic login credentials but had no luck since this is a HTB machine!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br>
													It turns out the system owner is not as dumb on this machine because <i>admin:admin</i> and <i>admin:password</i> both fail.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/13-login-fail.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												So this page presents the next challenge because one of the <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">exploits</a>
												I found (thanks to <i>searchsploit nibble</i>) requires valid login credentials to function. &nbsp;I used Hydra on this page but it would temporarily lockout after 16 failed attempts. &nbsp;For some time I
												cycled between attempting to crack the page and searching through backend files for clues. &nbsp;Eventually I came across a config file with interesting information. &nbsp;Down in the notification
												 information was an email field with "admin" and "bashed" in the address.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/14-default-creds.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												Using this lead, I tried <i>bashed</i> as the password instead. &nbsp;The result was a successful login to nibbleblog's dashboard!! &nbsp;It turns out the admin IS that lazy! &nbsp;\o/
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/15-login-success.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Exploit"><h2>Exploitation</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;After successfully logging into the backend dashboard, I played around with the directory to find interesting pages. &nbsp;There were many pages to uncover so I referred to
													the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2015-6967/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">CVE page</a> of my earlier found exploit. &nbsp;On the page was a
													<a href="https://curesec.com/blog/article/blog/NibbleBlog-403-Code-Execution-47.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">blog post</a> describing a
													manual Proof of Concept (PoC) for exploiting <i>CVE-2015-6967</i>. &nbsp;Basically <i>nibbleblog</i> fails to check file extensions when uploading files (images in this case), which would
													allow attackers to upload malicious executables. &nbsp;With that in mind, I confirmed the existence of an image uploading function in the <i>My image</i> plugin.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/18-select-image.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													The next step is to produce a payload to upload in the system. &nbsp;I tried <i>msfvenom</i> first but the payload failed for an unknown reason. &nbsp;Netcat would receive a connection from it
													but no shell would pop up! That payload command comes from <a href="https://netsec.ws/?p=331" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">netsec</a> under the <i>PHP</i> header in case you want to
													attempt. &nbsp;I instead googled <i>"php reverse shell"</i> and pulled up the first result.

												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/19-php-reverse.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													Download <i>php-reverse-shell.php</i> and change lines 49 and 50 to your listener IP and listener port number. &nbsp;Save the file as <i>image.php</i>
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/20-change-parameters.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													The payload is ready for action! &nbsp;Upload it to nibbleblog. &nbsp;Ignore the warnings per the blog post. &nbsp;<i>image.php</i> is uploaded to the
													directory <i>/content/private/plugins/my_image/</i>.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/21-upload-messages.png" alt="" /></div></center>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/22-image-location.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												 Make sure to start a netcat listener on the desired port before invoking your payload. &nbsp;Click on <i>image.php</i> to receive a shell! &nbsp;Navigate to the home directory to
												 dump flag contents!

								<br><section id="Privesc"><h2>Privilege Escalation</h2></section>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;Once a foothold was established, I began post-exploitation enumeration to find interesting files and permissions. &nbsp;I decided to look inside <i>personal.zip</i>
													because it looked intersting and stuck out. &nbsp;I unzipped it and discovered a shell script called <i>monitor.sh</i>.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/26-personal-unzip.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													I ran the script to inspect behavior but nothing interesting happened besides telling me what I already know; however, the green colored output gave me a clue about what to research. &nbsp;I
													suspected the text changed color due to <i>monitor.sh</i> running with elevated privileges.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/27-run-monitor.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													While researching Linux privilege escalation methods, I encountered this <a href="https://medium.com/schkn/linux-privilege-escalation-using-text-editors-and-files-part-1-a8373396708d" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">blog post</a>
													showing a very handy trick. &nbsp;Scenario 1 describes how to use sudo-enabled files to open system-level tools like <i>/bin/bash</i>. &nbsp;If you have write and execute permissions to a file that
													runs with elevated privileges, you can add commands such as system calls to get what you want. &nbsp;Use <i>sudo -l</i> to run this check. &nbsp;In our case, <i>monitor.sh</i> runs with root
													permissions! &nbsp;And most importantly, <i>monitor.sh</i> will NOT request a password when executing with sudo!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/28-check-sudo.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													Since we have ownership over the file, use bash commands to overwrite the contents of <i>monitor.sh</i>. &nbsp;In my case it was only three lines of code: the shebang line, a welcome message, and a
													call to the bash shell in interactive mode. &nbsp;This means whatever is written in <i>monitor.sh</i> will be executed as root if sudo is invoked.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/29-manipulate-monitor.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;Once <i>monitor.sh</i> has been overwritten, I ran it with sudo permissions. &nbsp;<code>sudo bash monitor.sh</code> did not work for some reason but <i>./</i> notation
													was fine. &nbsp;A root shell was acquired! &nbsp;Navigate to the <i>/root/</i> directory and dump the flag!
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/30-root-whoami.png" alt="" /></div></center>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/31-root-flag.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>



								<br><section id="Remediation"><h2>Remediation</h2></section>

												<p>
												&emsp; &emsp;Once again, this server contains default credentials which were tried on just the third password attempt. &nbsp;Although a security lockdown is in place, it is not enough to overcome
												the laziness of default credentials. &nbsp;Fixing this is low-hanging fruit.<br>
												&emsp; &emsp;The initial vulnerability in this writeup stems from Nibbleblog's <i>My image</i> plugin not checking for acceptable file extensions.
												&nbsp;OWASP produced a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">guide</a> on unrestricted file uploads, their risk factors,
												and various methods to mitigate them. &nbsp;Whitelisting file types is the easiest method in this case. &nbsp;This was remediated in Nibbleblog v4.0.5 and you can see the change in
												<i>/nibbleblog/admin/controllers/plugins/config.bit</i> at line 19
												(<a href="https://github.com/dignajar/nibbleblog/blob/master/admin/controllers/plugins/config.bit" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">source code</a>). &nbsp;The image upload function now
												checks for valid file extensions (jpg, gif, or png) before continuing. &nbsp;If you need this implemented in a function or pure PHP, StackOverflow also has some
												<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2486329/how-can-i-only-allow-certain-filetypes-on-upload-in-php" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">sample code</a> to implement.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/32-extension-check.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												The post-exploitation vulnerability is straightforward to fix. &nbsp;You can either disable NOPASSWD in the sudoers file (<i>/etc/sudoers</i>) or comment out the line with a '#'. &nbsp;One
												of two things will happen: the former forces a root password to be requested every time a user runs <i>sudo</i>. &nbsp;The latter option removes sudo privileges entirely. &nbsp;Find the line
												containing <i>nibbler</i>:<br><br>
												<code>nibbler ALL=(ROOT) NOPASSWD:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh</code><br><br>
												&nbsp;Remove "NOPASSWD" or comment out the line with a '#'; whichever makes the system owner comfortable. &nbsp;Use
												<i>visudo -f /etc/sudoers</i> to edit the file since it protects against many failure modes
												(<a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/615034/disable-nopasswd-sudo-access-for-ubuntu-user-on-an-ec2-instance" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">source</a>).
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/bashed/33-sudoers.png" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<p>
												Finally, the machine leaked header information again through nmap scans. &nbsp;I addressed this solution in Jerry's
												<a href="https://thestunneddefense.com/pages/jerry.html#Remediation" target="_blank" style="color:blue;"><i>Remediation</i> section</a>. &nbsp;Doing this for SSH is not quite the same. &nbsp;You
												cannot hide the version number of the SSH daemon; however, you can obfuscate the linux version by adding <i>"DebianBanner no"</i> to <i>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</i> then restart the process with
												<i>/etc/init.d/ssh_restart</i>.<br>
												&emsp; &emsp;The overall solution for the above vulnerabilities is upgrading to the latest Nibbleblog version. &nbsp;However according to their current
												<a href="https://github.com/dignajar/nibbleblog" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">repository</a>, Nibbleblog is no longer supported. &nbsp;Its original author, Diego Najar, has moved on to its
												successor platform: <a href="https://github.com/bludit/bludit" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">Bludit CMS</a>. &nbsp;Therefore migrating the blog to a supported platform is ideal.
												</p>



								<br><section id="Thoughts"><h2>Thoughts</h2></section>
												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp;<i>bashed</i> is a tricky box with many rabbitholes to fall into. &nbsp;This machine took some time due to proper enumeration and temptation to fall into its many rabbitholes.
													&nbsp;As difficulty of HTB machines increase, system enumeration becomes much more important. &nbsp;I suspect Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) methods could play an increasingly important
													role in later boxes. &nbsp;Overall I rate this box a 4/10 difficulty due to the number of possible pitfalls encountered. &nbsp;I also submitted separate ratings for each flag; user
													flag is 4/10 while root receives a lower score of 3/10.
