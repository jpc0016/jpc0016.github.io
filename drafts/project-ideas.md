# Project Ideas

Is there a program emulation function or partial code execution ability within GHIDRA?  Could look into developing this capability to speed up analysis
    * This is done in basic blocks and running JIT compilation

Investigate profiling compilers based on preambles.
    * There are differences between GCC and VS on Windows.
    * Supervised learning model:  Create list of binaries with compiler information, architecture/instruction set, etc.

Investigate use of P-code in Intermediate Representation (IR) analysis.  What exactly do I want to do with this?

Develop predictive models around NFL and MLB data sets.  What kind of questions do I want answered?

Analyzing PS3 and Nintendo Wii PowerPC architecture

Heuristic programming with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Dronekit python and integrating autonomous flight capabilities

Ethereum Development

Arduino/Raspberry Pi projects

Learn C#

Video game hacking
