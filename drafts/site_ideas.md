## Site Ideas

Add side panel for certain posts or post categories.  This panel would only be visible on posts.html and individual post pages.
  * side panel could be school project posts?

  * This is extremely hard.  Archived posts by year could be organized at bottom of posts.html page.

<!-- On posts.html, have links to separate posts.  The post will have the same template as index.html.  
The links will be kind of large and have a preview picture similar to Medium.com -->
