														<!-- NEED TO LINK TO PART 1 IN THIS PARAGRAPH -->
													&emsp; &emsp; Good morning everyone! &nbsp; This post is a continuation of <a href="../pages/vigenere.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">Part 1</a>
													in which Vigenere encryption and decryption were constructed, tested, and evaluated using Python. &nbsp;The remaining project consists of cracking
													the Vigenere cipher with cryptanalysis via statistical methods. &nbsp;Two goals are achieved. &nbsp;The first is determining the key used. &nbsp;The second
													goal is recovery of the plaintext. &nbsp;Python is still involved!
											 	</p>


													<!-- SECOND HALF: BREAKING CIPHER-->

												<h3>&emsp; Starting With Frequency Analysis</h3>
                         <p>&emsp; &emsp; Encryption and decryption are interesting, but breaking the cipher matters more. &nbsp;This can be done using exhaustive
													 search (brute force) or statistical analysis methods. &nbsp;Exhaustive search is useful when the key size is small enough. &nbsp;Statistical
													 analysis is interesting because it can reveal key length when used correctly; however in this assignment, the key length is
													 known so sophisticated statistical analysis is not required. &nbsp;If interested in decrypting ciphertext WITHOUT knowing key
													  length, <a href="https://nostarch.com/crackingcodes" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">Al Sweigart's book</a> walks through
													 a more comprehensive approach in chapter 18. &nbsp;Regardless of knowing key length, statistical analysis requires frequency
													 analysis of the encryption key's characters. &nbsp;Certain letters occur more frequently in the English language than others. &nbsp;Below
													 is a frequency table expressed in decimal form.


												 </p>
												 <center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/vigenere-5/freq-analysis.PNG" width="500" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												 <p>&emsp; &emsp; We clearly see vowels occur more often and <i>E</i> is by far used the most; its frequency is 0.130, while
													 <i>A</i> and <i>O</i> are both
													0.080. &nbsp;Determining where these vowels occur in ciphertext will not be a problem. &nbsp;Challenges begin when analyzing
													the remaining letters since they are relatively close together in frequency. &nbsp;This is where a neat mathematical principle
													is used (credit goes to YouTuber <i>Theoretically</i> in this <a href="https://youtu.be/LaWp_Kq0cKs?t=342" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">video</a>).
													<br>&emsp; &emsp;Suppose a key, <i>ABC</i>, is represented by <i>(0, 1, 2)</i> which denotes each letter's position in the
													English alphabet. &nbsp;Multiplying each value by itself and summing everything yields the largest possible value. &nbsp;This is done by
													multiplying the largest values together and the smallest values together. &nbsp;Below is an illustration of the concept:
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/vigenere-5/coincidence.PNG" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
												<p>&emsp; &emsp; As <i>Theoretically</i> stated, the largest possible value occurs when each number lines up. &nbsp;This means the largest
													possible value occurs when key values to create ciphertext align with key values to decrypt the ciphertext. &nbsp;A rough sketch looks
													like this:
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/vigenere-5/visual.PNG" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp; Notice the placement of key characters in both processes (encrypt and decrypt). &nbsp;Since the key has the same starting point
													in both encryption and decryption, its characters do not change position. &nbsp;Using the alignment principle from earlier, the key can be
													recovered with relatively high confidence. &nbsp;A number spike means it is very likely the key is correctly aligned with ciphertext characters
													to accurately decrypt it to plaintext. &nbsp;So how is this principle applied in code?
													<br>
													&emsp; &emsp; Knowing the length of the Vigenere key means the hard work is already done. &nbsp;We can split the ciphertext into groups of
													text equal to the period (key length). &nbsp;So for a period of <i>4</i>, split the ciphertext into <i>4</i> groups of text. &nbsp;Each
													group corresponds to a character position in the key. &nbsp;Continuing the example (period <i>4</i>), the first group of text represents
													the first letter of the key. &nbsp;The second group represents the second letter of the key and so on. &nbsp;Below is a microcosmic illustration
													followed by its Python implementation.
												</p>
												<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/vigenere-5/groups.PNG" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>

												<pre>
													<code class="language-python" style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
# groups is the list that holds each group of strings.
groups = []

# String splicing loop
# value for each character in range, step over the string at an offset 'period'
for i in range(0, period):
    groups.append(cipherText[i: len(cipherText): period])

# Print each text group
print(" ")
for j in range(0, period):
    print(groups[j])
print(" ")
													</code>
												</pre>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp; Each text group above is colored by position. &nbsp;Group 1 contains the first, fifth, ninth, and thirteenth characters. &nbsp;Group
													2 has the same offset starting at the second letter. &nbsp;Groups 3 and 4 repeat the same pattern starting at third and fourth letters respectively.
													 &nbsp;Once groups of text are allocated, frequency analysis needs to be done on each group. &nbsp;So we need to determine where large number spikes
													 occur. &nbsp;This happens by superimposing the dictionary of letter counts (<i>letterFrequency</i>) on top of the frequency table of English
													 letters (englishFrequency). &nbsp;The latter is simply the frequency table above in dictionary form. &nbsp;As illustrated earlier, multiply each
													 corresponding key-value pair and sum them all up. &nbsp;This needs to be repeated 25 more times after shifting the dictionary by one place. &nbsp;
													 Because dictionary key-values need to wrap around, the shifted dictionary must be an <i>OrderedDict()</i>. &nbsp;Shifts are also handled by a custom
													 function outside the scope of <i>frequency_analysis</i>. &nbsp;At the end of each loop, each sum is appended to a comprehensive list which ends
													 up being 26 numbers long. &nbsp;Below are the functions depicting everything above.

#
# then sum = (0.0 * 0.080) + (0.0789 * 0.015) + (0.0 * 0.030)

												</pre>

												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp; Now that the main frequency analysis function is developed, a list of the top 3 most likely characters is needed. &nbsp;This is
													because the highest calculated sum is not always correct; however, the complete answer is typically in the top 3 highest calculated
													sums. &nbsp;The calculation uses a ratio of letters found to
													letters in its group; NOT the entire ciphertext. &nbsp;In order to retrieve the highest values, the list of 26 sums from <i>frequency_analysis()</i> needs to be sorted and spliced
													by <i>[:3]</i>. &nbsp;Since <i>frequency_analysis()</i> takes a character group as input, a small list can be made for each character of the
													key. &nbsp;After converting the values back to letters, a list of lists is created. &nbsp;The master top 3 list (<i>list_of_top3</i>) is made
													 out of each small list. &nbsp;Continuing our simple test case, the ciphertext 'SECGLEYWAMNRJUOT...............................' produces the master top 3 list:
													 <code>[['S', 'H', 'O'], ['T', 'S', 'M'], ['U', 'Y', 'E'], ['N', 'A', 'Y']]</code>. &nbsp;The key is 'STUN' as seen from the first letter of each
													 small list. &nbsp;Below is the code to create <i>list_of_top3</i>:
												</p>
												<pre>
													<code class="language-python" style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
# Create an array of lists of the top 3 sums of each key character
# Example: [[A,B,C], [D,E,F], [G,H,I]] for a key length/period of 3
#
# Implement all steps for each key character.  Loop from 0 to period
list_of_top3 = []
for num in range(0, period):

    # Retrieve the list of all sums (all_sums)
    counts = frequency_analysis(groups[num], len(groups[num]))

    # Sort list of sums from highest to lowest
    sorted_sums = sorted(counts, reverse=True)

    # Take the highest 3 sums from the sorted list
    first_3 = sorted_sums[:3]
    top_3 = []

    # Convert top 3 sums from numbers to letters and add to top_3 characters list
    for item in first_3:
        top_3.append(character_key[counts.index(item)])

    # Add top_3 characters list to total top 3 list.  This is a list of lists.
    list_of_top3.append(top_3)
													</code>
												</pre>
												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp; All that's left is to brute force each key combination by testing plaintext output against the number of English words found. &nbsp;To do this,
													we open a dictionary text document as a file and compare its words to decryption results. &nbsp;Two arrays are initialized for this process: one to hold each
													 decrypted string (<i>plaintext_array</i>) and one to hold each string's corresponding English word count (<i>table_of_counts</i>). &nbsp;The winner is the plaintext string corresponding to
													 the highest English word count. &nbsp;The decryption function is the same from <i>vigenere.py</i>. &nbsp;The function definition is not in this file but imported as a
													 module. &nbsp;Below is the code to cycle through each decryption attempt. &nbsp;<i>joined_keys</i> is just a pre-formatted list of all
													 possible key combinations.
												</p>
												<pre>
													<code class="language-python" style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
# Brute force the ciphertext with each possible key in joined_keys
# Open dictionary.txt for word search in each decrypted string
# Initialize table of dictionary word counts (table_of_counts).  The index
# with the highest count will return its corresponding recovered plaintext
# indexed in plaintext_array. The plaintext_array will be referenced when
# printing the solution
filename = 'doc/dictionary.txt'
table_of_counts = []
plaintext_array = []

for attempt in joined_keys:

    with open(filename) as f:
        english_word_count = 0
        words = f.read().splitlines()

        # Call decrypt function from vigenere and add it to plaintext_array
        plain = decrypt(cipherText, attempt)
        plaintext_array.append(plain)

        # Iterate over each word in dictionary.txt
        # If the dictionary word is in the string, increment english_word_count
        for word in words:
            if plain.count(word) > 0:
                english_word_count += 1

        # Add total english word count to table when done searching all words
        table_of_counts.append(english_word_count)
        f.close()
													</code>
												</pre>
												<p>
													&emsp; &emsp; The remaining code consists of properly printing the output. &nbsp;This could be simplified by turning
													the previous code snippet into a function. &nbsp;Basically call the proper index values.
												</p>
												<pre>
													<code class="language-python" style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
# Show index of max English word count to retrieve proper plaintext
print(table_of_counts.index(max(table_of_counts)))

# Display recovered plaintext and key used
print("\n####################################")
print("\nRecovered Plaintext: " + plaintext_array[table_of_counts.index(max(table_of_counts))])
print("\nKey used: " + joined_keys[table_of_counts.index(max(table_of_counts))])
print("\n####################################")

													&emsp; &emsp; Vigenere's cipher is a novel update to the Caesar cipher which makes use of variable length keys instead of static rotation
													values. &nbsp;Although very weak by modern standards, the encryption scheme is worth investigating in beginner cryptography and computer security courses; especially implementing
													it in code. &nbsp;The <a href="https://github.com/jpc0016/Vigenere/blob/master/project/cryptanalysis.py" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">full code</a> above and the
													repository for the entire project can be found <a href="https://github.com/jpc0016/Vigenere/tree/master/project" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">here</a>.
													 &nbsp;For further reading, the test case document in <code>/doc/Test_Cases.odt</code> includes a test in which the highest calculated values do NOT recover the key; thus validating the need for
													 calculating top 3 values. &nbsp;Please reach out if you have questions!
