                        <h2>&emsp; Another Crackme and Introduction to GNU Debugger</h2>
                        <div class="box">
                          <p>Good afternoon, Tim.  For this post, I will explore a crackme <a href="https://github.com/jpc0016/dont_hate_the_hacker_hate_the_code" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">repository</a>
														I did for an interview.  It contains four binary files increasing in difficulty [except for <i>crackme2</i>].  While I was
														only assigned the first crackme	file, it was not the easiest of the group. I mentioned default GNU tools and their usefulness
														 in quick debugging in the previous post.  They are even more useful in learning reverse engineering basics.
													</p>

													<p>As stated in the title, I introduce the GNU Not Unix (GNU) debugger in this article since I used it to solve <i>crackme</i>.  This was the first reverse
														engineering challenge binary I solved; therefore, my methodology was primative compared to current techniques.  For example due to the turnaround time, I used <i>objdump</i>
														to grab the disassembly and start hasty analysis.  You can use Ghidra or Radare2 to disassemble this file but I will instead focus on how to map
														a <b>basic</b> binary's behavior.
													</p>
													<p>
														When ready, fork the provided repository and clone it to your local machine: <br>
														<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/jpc0016/dont_hate_the_hacker_hate_the_code
														</pre></code>
													</p>

													<p>
														For simplicity I isolated the working <i>crackme</i> into its own directory.  First thing I do is execute a <i>file</i> command
														to extract pertinent header information.
														<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/file-command.png" width="1000" alt="" /></div></center><br>
                          </p>
													<br>
													<p>
														The file is an x86 64-bit ELF executable so <i>objdump</i> should work on it.  Enter the command below to output
														x86 disassembly into a text file or <i>.s</i> file.  Since the output is relatively large, the text file helps to avoid manual
														 inspection on the terminal.
														 <pre><code>$ objdump -d -M x86-64,intel crackme > output.s
														 </pre></code>
														I specified intel syntax with <i>-M</i> to make the output cleaner.  Atom has an assembly language package that highlights
														syntax.  In Atom, go to <b>Edit</b> > <b>Preferences</b> > <b>Install</b> to open the package installer.  Search for "Assembly"
														and install the first result.  The output should look like this:
													</p>
													<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/output-assembly.png" width="600" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>
														This may seem intimidating if you are not used to assembly language.  In the above code, <i>&lt;main&gt;</i> executes some jump
														instructions and makes a couple of function calls to <i>printf</i> and <i>checksum</i>.  From here I manually mapped out
														blocks of assembly code based on jump instructions.  I only wrote down important instructions such as comparisons (<i>cmp</i>),
														function calls (<i>call</i>), conditional jumps (<i>je</i>), etc.  As evident in the output, there is a lot of movement among
														registers in between the instructions of interest.  Below is the <i>&lt;main&gt;</i> function mapped out.
													</p>
													<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/function-map.jpg" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>
														Again, these were very rudimentary steps due to learning x86 assembly.  Most disassemblers have built-in function graphing tools;
														 however, this is only one step of the solution.	 I tested the binary to record observations before proceeding:
														 <br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/crackme-test.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
														 It appears the binary expects an input parameter and returns usage instructions if not found.  When dummy input is used,
														 I get a <i>wrong password</i> prompt as expected.  When cross-referenced with the function graph, the first <i>jump if equal</i>
														 instruction checks for a password parameter.  The second one determines if the desired instruction block is displayed ("Tada! Congrats").
														 This is how control flow is dictated. If certain compare statements are not as expected, the program continues to instruction
														 blocks that print fail messages.
													</p>
													<p>
														Moving on to the next block (cmp == 2 is satisfied), there is a local variable loaded into register <i>rax</i>.  It is
														also moved into	<i>rdi</i> and passed as a parameter to <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i>.  Whatever happens in
														<i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i>, it is compared to 0xdee to unlock the victory message.  This message can	be seen using
														<i>strings</i>	on the file:
														<pre><code>$ strings crackme
....
[]A\A]A^A_
Usage: %s password
Wrong password
Tada! Congrats
;*3$"
....
														</pre></code>
													</p>
													<p>
														One way to bypass <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i> is to patch the binary by setting <i>rax</i> to 0xdee before it is loaded
														onto the stack.  This does not technically solve the binary but merely patches the instruction.  This can be done in
														 <i>GDB</i> with the following command:
														 <pre><code>(gdb)	set $rax=0xdee
 														</pre></code>
													</p>
													<p>So how can this problem best be approached?  This is where dynamic analysis is useful in determining how the binary
													behaves.  The <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i> function is clearly doing something that should return 0xdee.  A breakpoint can be set
													at the beginning of <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i> so walkthrough can occur.  This helps determine step-by-step what the function
													is actually doing.  Run the below command to open the crackme file in gdb.  Then set a breakpoint at the <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i>
													 address.</p>
<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/gdb-start.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>Next, type the following commands to run the program and set the disassembly syntax.
														<pre><code>
(gdb)	run foobar
(gdb)	set disassembly-flavor intel
														</pre></code>
													</p>
													<p>
														GDB has a few commands that are extremely useful in navigating a binary.
														<pre><code>
(gdb)	info registers
(gdb)	stepi
(gdb)	continue
(gdb)	display/i $pc
														</pre></code>
														The output of <i>info registers</i>
														is shown below.  <i>stepi</i> steps through the program one instruction at a time and <i>continue</i>
														moves through the program to the next breakpoint.  The command <i>display/i $pc</i> is particularly
														useful in showing the current assembly instruction.  The instruction shown is what will be executed
														on the next step.  In the below screenshot, the instruction	<i>call 0x40057d	checksum</i> is executed
														 next.
													</p>
<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/info-registers.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>
													Normally I execute a combination of <i>stepi</i> and <i>info registers</i>. Take note of
													 changes in register values as this can reveal patterns in the binary.  Be sure to reference the assembly
													 code of <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i> when stepping through.  Below is its assembly output.
												 </p>
<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/checksum-assembly.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
												 <p>
													 The first couple of instructions seem to load
													 a parameter on the stack and initialize a number to zero.  It is not until after instruction 0x4005a3
													 that real-time calculations can be observed.  Once instruction 0x4005aa is reached, register <i>rax</i>
													 contains the value 0x66 which is the ASCII representation for <i>f</i>.  Refering to previous instructions,
													 there is a change between 0x4005a3 and 0x4005a7 with respect to rax.  The address of rbp-0x18 was loaded
													 into rax at instruction 0x4005a3.  Executing <code>x/s 0x7fffffffdeee</code> in GDB yields the password
													 parameter, "<i>foobar</i>;" these are the <b>contents</b> of rax.  Instruction 0x4005a7 moves one byte of
													 the contents of rax into eax and pads with zeros.  <i>f</i> is only one byte so the logic makes sense so far.
													</p>
<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/gdb-first-register.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>
														The program fails the first conditional branch at 0x4005aa and jumps to 0x4005af where 0x7fffffffdeee is
														once again loaded into rax.  Moving through the next few instructions, rax alternates between its effective
														address (0x7fffffffdeee) and its value (0x66).  Upon reaching instruction 0x4005a7, 0x6f is loaded into rax.
														This is the value for character <i>o</i>.  There is now a clear pattern of stepping through each password
														character; however, more analysis is needed to determine what is happening to	the values.  A closer inspection
														of <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i> reveals rax being added to rbp+0x8 at instruction 0x40059a.  This value was previously
														initialized to 0 at instruction 0x400585.  Continuing this process to instruction 0x4005ae shows every character
														in rax until the end of the password string.  I set a breakpoint and continued.
													</p>
													<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/gdb-continue.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>
														At this point, the next instructions will load rpb-0x8 into rax and return to <i>main()</i>.  Looking back
														at the assembly, there is only one instance of rpb-0x8 besides its initialization.  The contents of rax are
														added to it one byte at a time in instruction 0x40059a.  Armed with this knowledge, it appears the value of
														rax in the below output is the sum of each character of <i>foobar</i>.
													</p>
													<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/gdb-sum.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>
													<p>
														Character summation is confirmed when checking an ASCII table.
														<pre><code>
102(f) + 111(o) + 111(o) + 98(b) + 97(a) + 114(r) = 633 = 0x279
														</pre></code>
													</p>
													<p>
														After returning to <i>main()</i>, rax is again loaded into rbp-0x8 which is subsequently compared to 0xdee.  Based
														on the activity in <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i>, simply refer to the ASCII table for a character combination that adds
														up to 0xdee.  This is equivalent to 3566 in decimal.  I used the highest character, '~' valued at 126, and two
														capital 'Rs'.  Test the string with <i>./crackme</i>.
														<br>
														<br>
														Tada! Congrats
														<pre><code>
(126(~) x 27) + (82(R) x 2) = 3566 = 0xdee
														</pre></code>
													</p>
													<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/crackme-solve.png" width="700" alt="" /></div></center><br>





													<p>
														<h2>Confirmation With Ghidra</h2>
														When analyzing the <i>&lt;checksum&gt;</i> function in Ghidra, I verified its activity in the
														decompiler window.  Below is its representative C code:
													</p>
<br><center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/crackme/decompile-checksum.png" width="500" alt="" /></div></center><br>

													<p>
														A local character array is initialized and set to the string <i>pcParm1</i>.  A string is a char array with a
														null terminator '\0' at the end.  The null terminator is numerically equivalent to zero, which means the <i>while</i>
														loop loops through each character until reaching zero.  In the loop body, the local variable is added to itself and
														the character index is incremented by one.  Hopefully this summary is clear enough!
													</p>
													<p>
														I highly recommend picking up at least one programming language if serious about reverse engineering.  C is the best choice
														since it is closest to the hardware, thus better suited for low-level access to memory.  This is important since sophisticated binaries
														are known to hide processes in memory.  Intermediate to advanced analysts should become very familiar with C++ since class structures
														are common in malware.
