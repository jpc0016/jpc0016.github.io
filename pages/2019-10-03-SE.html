                        <div class="box">
                          <p>&emsp; &emsp; Good evening Tim and Aaron! &nbsp;I was on hiatus due to school and spent copious amounts of time wondering how Auburn
														STUNNED Oregon with twenty seconds left in the fourth quarter. &nbsp;This post will cover the pros and cons of
														Systems Engineering (SE) and how to effectively use the development process. &nbsp;A colleague once said SE is like salt; a
														little bit is great, but too much can be problematic. &nbsp;This is admittedly a bit paraphrased but holds true across
														companies and industry sectors.	&nbsp;While useful in determining problems and brainstorming solutions, SE has limitations
														beyond early phases. &nbsp;Having spent a few years in the SE world, I will communicate its overall effectiveness. &nbsp;This post
														contains three pros	and four cons. &nbsp;The pros focus on useful attributes to take away from SE while cons are primarily about
														SE as a career choice.
													</p><br>


													<!--PROS-->


													<!--Great way to learn big picture architecture of a system-->
													<h3>&emsp; The Big Picture</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Wikipedia's definition states SE is "an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on
															how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles." &nbsp;SE focuses on the overarching design of products
															and engineering solutions. &nbsp;At its core, SE is management encapsulated by various engineering professions; which allows great visibility
															into a system's big picture. &nbsp;The most common SE approach is the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which frequently appears in various Information Technology
															 (IT) certifications. &nbsp;An example life-cycle approach, again stolen from Wikipedia, is below and is commonly referred to as the "V-model".&nbsp;The official
															International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) model may slightly differ, but the overall process is the same.
															<div class="image post" style="float:right"><img src="../images/SE/1024px-Systems_Engineering_Process_II.svg.png" width="700" alt=""></div>
															The V-model illustrates the product design process. &nbsp;A smart person writes down a promising idea, but needs guidance on how to proceed. &nbsp;What
															is the next step? &nbsp;Referring to a concrete model simplifies the development process and causes less frustration in the beginning. &nbsp;In
															software engineering for example, a developer does not code their entire project all at once. &nbsp;That is usually too difficult for significant projects. &nbsp;
															Instead software engineers incrementally write and test the project to ensure functionality of its building blocks. &nbsp; The development process, much
															like the system life cycle process, is a methodical journey with validation ensured. &nbsp;Each step of the system life cycle allows for product
															assessment. &nbsp;It is built with flexibility in mind to allow for potential validation failures and corrective action. &nbsp;However, these are typically
															the shortest steps of the model as the longest steps involve ironing out capabilities, design, expectations, and requirements. &nbsp;Errors are common to all
															projects when checking the "issues" tab in open source repositories; therefore, it is a project lead's responsibility to incorporate
															verification tracking and follow-on maintenance.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; The best method of incorporating SE in small sections is to task responsibilities to team members. &nbsp;For example, each member
															writes a slide for their piece of the project to demonstrate progress. &nbsp;Most early steps in system definition phase should already be handled by the
															time a small team is tasked. &nbsp;Should further scope be required, only quick "stand-up" meetings are needed. &nbsp;These can be accomplished in common work
															areas and should take no more than 30 minutes to an hour. &nbsp;A white board is always required and is your best friend. &nbsp;Above all, do not make
															the process unnecessarily complicated.

															<!-- Need more content here. Particularly on "how to effectively use the development process".  In other words, provide details on its
														applicability to other processes and engineering fields.  Management ability is rewarded.-->
														</p><br>


														<!--Systems engineering experience helps you break down big problems.
														Discuss requirements here.-->
													<h3>&emsp; Breaking Down Problems</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; As stated above, SE deals with problems of scale requiring many calculated steps. &nbsp;Trying to conquer everything at
															once leads to disorganization, frustration, and ultimately lack of results. &nbsp;Like software engineering, SE involves breaking
															big problems into little problems. &nbsp;Some refer to this as a "modular approach" to engineering, since a system is subdivided
															into managable building blocks.  &nbsp;This does not always happen easily and requires deliberate planning. &nbsp;For example,
															suppose you are to design a corporate network spanning multiple sites.  &nbsp;One approach is to examine multiple factors such as
															budget, required services, and backup plans which collectively leads to developing a list of requirements. &nbsp;These requirements can span multiple levels of
															the system and often have sub-requirements. &nbsp;Ultimately this boils down to input requirements satisfying a higher level
															requirement. &nbsp;Much like the linear signals and systems diagram below, system design and requirements analysis behaves the same way
															by evaluating inputs (<i>x</i>) to the system (<i>h(x)</i>) and analyzing the output produced (<i>y(x)</i>).

															<!-- Block Diagram example goes here-->
															<center><div class="image post"><img src="../images/SE/block-diagram.png" width="500" alt=""></div></center><br>

															This is the ultimate goal of SE: to create the simplest model of a system without neglecting critical details. &nbsp;Real life
															systems will obviously never be like the diagram above. &nbsp;More intricate flowcharts are used and can differ slightly between lateral
															system components. &nbsp;What matters is the appropriate level of detail is present to effectively depict system inputs and outputs. &nbsp;The
															highest levels of context are	expressed as Operation Viewpoint charts (usually OV-1). &nbsp;According to the Department of Defense
															 Architecture Framework (DODAF), there are many more sub-models and charts used to depict system architecture; however, using
															 them all is overkill. &nbsp;There is no need to get bogged down in unnecessary details so the system architect
															 determines which information is relevant for OV charts. &nbsp;The beauty of DODAF is its comprehensiveness and breakdown
															 of which data goes where. &nbsp;Selectiveness is key.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Using SE techniques in small teams is great for product visualization. &nbsp;For these individuals,
															 techniques beyond basic flowchart, requirements definition, and documentation steps is unnecessary. &nbsp;This is because SE is considered overhead for
															 this type of team executing the actual work. &nbsp;As long as project goals are broken down into incremental steps and phases, an
															  engineering team will be successful.
														</p><br>


														<h3>&emsp;Developing Documentation</h3>
														<p>
														<!--Strong documentation is a product of SE -->

															&emsp; &emsp; Another major upside to SE is developing strong documentation skills. &nbsp;These are
															tied to writing skills, which are often lacking in other engineering fields. &nbsp;Although document review is dry, SE provides opportunities
															 to develop your own documentation and exercise an in-demand skillset because someone needs to write the System Requirements Specification (SRS)! &nbsp;When
															 writing these types of deliverables (not just SRS) remind yourself of its purpose, its scope, and its audience. &nbsp;For smaller teams, documentation
															 may not come in the form of deliverable specifications. &nbsp;Instead it is likely used for organization and quick references.
															 <br>
															 &emsp; &emsp; Software engineering has been particularly	vocal about the shortcoming in good writers. &nbsp;Unfortunately many open source tools provide lackluster
															  documentation resulting in hundreds of issues in their Github repositories. &nbsp;I encountered one set of install instructions that was two basic steps before referring users to the Wiki
														or leaving a GitHub issue. &nbsp;Not one team member laid out dependencies, requirements, or even architecture. Worst of all, this project was the basis of a Ph.D
														dissertation! &nbsp;Poor communication leads to potential users rejecting your product or the development team unable to retrace steps, which is frankly unacceptable.
														 &nbsp;Therefore, strong documentation skills will make an engineer stand out among peers and ultimately produce a concise workflow.
													 </p><br>



														<!-- CONS-->

														<!--Too high level to be considered engineering.  No engineering degree needed to do actual work
															In contrast, SE also overly complicates tasks to give an appearance that more work is being done than what is required.
														Mention OV-1 charts here-->
													<h3>&emsp; Too High Level?</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Modularity in system design is great but is it perhaps too high in the sky for engineers of other disciplines? &nbsp;There is
															a reason SE contains "management" so prominently in its definition, because it IS a management-based engineering discipline. &nbsp;This is not to
															write off management; only to define it as a leadership-based art and science, which is quite different from technical capability. &nbsp;Certain
															industries do not require engineering degrees for systems engineers. &nbsp;This infers SE work can be done by non-technical majors and
															is more appropriate for business school graduates. &nbsp;When reviewing actual SE work, this assumption holds true. &nbsp;What tools do
															systems engineers use? &nbsp;Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook are the most common tools. &nbsp;Sometimes Microsoft Visio is included
															when designing flowcharts. &nbsp;IT systems engineers will [hopefully] use Linux Operating Systems (OSs), Wireshark, command line tools, and
															 maybe PowerShell; however, these people are the exceptions. &nbsp;I entered exactly zero linux commands during my systems engineering tenure. &nbsp;Microsoft
															 Office suite and document review reigned supreme and no engineering degree was necessary to fulfill job duties.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE is considered high-level, systems engineers are sometimes required to dig into the true meaning of
															 requirements. &nbsp;Sometimes this is a valid issue as catching mistakes early can save the program money long term. &nbsp;What
															actually happens is tons of time is wasted analyzing "shall" statements in attempts to feign importance to the customer. &nbsp;SE tends
															to breed an environment that rewards overcomplicating tasks to give an appearance that more work is being done than necessary. &nbsp;This of course
															leads into why DODAF contains such an enourmous amount of charts and models; most of which are unnecessary. &nbsp;When is an OV-6 diagram ever
															necessary? &nbsp;Instead, SE should remain	as simple as possible to allow effective communication of project goals. &nbsp;Thankfully this is well
															done in other industry sectors.

														</p><br>


														<!--Not a key developmental position for young engineers-->
													<h3>&emsp; Not a Key Development Position (KDP)</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; With everything SE offers, why is there a vast age gap in the industry? &nbsp;The median age was upper 40s in most meetings I attended. &nbsp;In
															reality, SE is suitable for engineers who	have spent time developing products earlier in their careers. &nbsp;A cybersecurity engineer
															would make a great systems engineer but	the corollary is not necessarily true; which is funny because I made that exact jump from SE
															to cybersecurity. &nbsp;However, I relied on my masters program when interviewing rather than my SE work. &nbsp;A newly graduated engineer should not be going into SE if a
															business major could execute the same non-technical work such	as action item tracking. &nbsp;From a student's perspective, why attempt
															the rigor of engineering school if a business major can complete the same tasks?
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; In the same vein as KDPs, continuing education recommendations are also disconcerning. &nbsp;Because SE is managerial in nature, higher-ups often
															recommend getting a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) to "check the box" of simply holding a masters degree. &nbsp;Unless the degree is from a top 10
															business school, an MBA is basically worthless; but that topic is an entire post of its own. &nbsp;If you are an engineer who enjoys learning and
															 discovering how systems, computers, applied mathematics, or general natural environments work, this attitude	is particularly alarming. &nbsp;This is
															  not the approach to continuing education that management should	emphasize. &nbsp;PhD holders are unicorns in SE environments. &nbsp;Although they
																preach the values of post-graduate studies, management is extremely reluctant to pay for continuing education if they cannot use your future credentials to bid on
															 work. &nbsp;Peers have told me they had to jump through hoops for an employer to reimburse PhD courses. &nbsp;"Why get a PhD?" &nbsp;Publication and mastery of
															 your field are apparently not enough. &nbsp;For this reason alone, full-time SE sectors perpetuate anti-intellectual behavior in an ironic attempt to
															 support masters degrees and continuing education.
															<br>
															<!-- One dimensional and dead-end type of job-->
														 &emsp; &emsp; Even though SE bills itself as interdisciplinary, the work itself is one-dimensional. &nbsp;A systems engineer does not directly develop the system solutions
														  nor do they perform the actual integration of said solutions. &nbsp;This means dedicated SE is a dead-end job in which lateral
														 movement to other engineering fields are greatly hindered. &nbsp;If the company structure is top-down with many levels of management, the effect is worsened and
														 if the systems engineer happens to be in middle-management, they are essentially shoehorned to be a systems engineer for life. At that point, you better love your job
														 because you are stuck! &nbsp;In contrast, a software engineer learns about development, OSs, programming languages, data structures, and various technical aspects
														 that plug into other engineering fields. &nbsp;Unless career trajectory involves management, SE practitioners often lack the freedom of maneuver of other
														 disciplines. &nbsp;I recommend limiting dedicated SE jobs to two years if other engineering fields sound appealing and avoid entry/junior SE positions at all costs.
														</p><br>


														<!--Meetings tend to be the product, not the system itself-->
														<h3>&emsp; More Meetings</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; I have witnessed various <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23infosec&src=typed_query" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">#InfoSec</a>
															personalities on Twitter state how much they loathe meetings; sometimes going	into great detail. &nbsp;They will use Slack, email,
															and phone calls to ensure pointless meetings are non-existent. &nbsp;To them, meetings on their calendars are present for a legitimate
															 reason; however, this is not necessarily the case for SE.
															<br>
															&emsp; &emsp; Depending on the industry, deliverables are determined by meetings and documents reviewed rather than producing
															the system itself. &nbsp;Programs often have Preliminary Design Reviews (PDRs), Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), and Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs)
															to determine program direction and effectiveness. &nbsp;These are understandably long meetings which require input and participation from all parties. &nbsp;Then
															there are smaller meetings leading up to the big meetings. &nbsp;Most are tag-ups to gauge progress or work on requirements/specifications matrices. &nbsp;In
															reality the vast majority of small meetings are unnecessary busy work designed to get "face-time" with customers and project members. &nbsp;They
															are based on archaic principles left over from the corporate world to which older employees are accustomed. &nbsp;To that end, SE is not a traditionally flexible
															engineering discipline and lacks forward-looking innovative measures, which is harmful in the long run as it becomes difficult to
															recruit Millennial and Generation-Z engineers.
														</p><br>


														<!--More prone to "butts in seats" work-->
													<h3>&emsp; "Butts-in-Seats"</h3>
														<p>
															&emsp; &emsp; Although SE contains valid work, some business sectors are inundated with systems engineers to an unnecessary degree. &nbsp;This
															plethora causes a depression in the worth of their work. &nbsp;There are only so many engineers that can be thrown at a requirements
															document before waste occurs. &nbsp;It never occurs to managers, stakeholders, or even system owners how much money, time, and effort is wasted at
															various levels.
														</p>
														<p>
															<div class="image post" style="float:left"><img src="../images/SE/butt_in_seat.png" width="300" alt=""></div>
													  	&emsp; &emsp; This depression causes tons of downtime and ultimately boredom for more ambitious employees. &nbsp;As previously mentioned,
															 overcomplication of menial tasks gives an appearance of "productivity;" productivity that is unsolicited. &nbsp;Appearance is the bottom line. &nbsp;Over
															 time this becomes exhausting, especially in an office full of inflated egos. &nbsp;Acronyms are a great example of appearance inflation. &nbsp;Most of
															 the time they are legitimate and useful for quickly communicating types of systems, sub-systems, parts, and concepts. &nbsp;In the SE world, acronyms
															 act as a second language and are sometimes made up. &nbsp;I encountered one systems engineer who regularly created two letter acronyms for his chart
															  packages.	&nbsp;Why would someone do that? &nbsp;More work is required to track new acronyms and communicate shared understanding to stakeholders. &nbsp;It ties
																back to appearance of effort. &nbsp;Just throw three letters together and think of a name so everyone gets the impression that engineers are conducting
																"business." &nbsp;Acronym abuse is rampant and ultimately wasteful.
															 <br>
															 &emsp; &emsp; Depending on the company, SE is very prone to "body shop" type of work. &nbsp;This is usually another outcome of depression
															 caused by too many systems engineers. &nbsp;I have heard from friends and coworkers about jobs in which they were left alone for upwards of
															 three months at a time! &nbsp;One coworker coined this as "butts-in-seats" type of work where people are hired to fill a contract. &nbsp;Unsurprisingly
															 these are usually SE positions.

														</p><br>


														<h2>&emsp; Analysis</h2>
															<p>
																&emsp; &emsp; SE is a discipline that contains incredibly useful principles that should be applied to every engineering
																field. &nbsp;At a high level, SE is great for organization and identifying problems and pitfalls in projects. &nbsp;Remember to use it as a "pinch of salt"
																to avoid burdening the project.
																<br>
																&emsp; &emsp; Limitations of SE should be considered at the small team level, although a small team will likely never reach them. &nbsp;Additionally, I
																consider stand-alone systems engineers as	engineering generalists; meaning their work is ultimately overhead for actual engineering teams. &nbsp;If
																considering an SE position, the following questions need addressing before the interview:

																	<ol type="1">
																		<li>Are you at least a mid-level engineer?</li>
																		<li>Do you want to be management?</li>
																		<li>Do you enjoy meetings?</li>
																	  <li>How long do you wish to stay a systems engineer?</li>
																	  <li>Do you have a plan for graduate school?</li>
																		<li>Do the Project Management Professional (PMP) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certifications excite you?</li>
																	</ol>

																If any responses to these questions are in doubt, SE is likely not for you. &nbsp;Some technology companies have specialized SE
																positions that retain technical proficiency, but these are exceptions. &nbsp;Overall SE principles are fantastic and worth using in projects. &nbsp;There is a reason
																systems-based approaches have permeated engineering fields. &nbsp;On the contrary, I advise against a dedicated SE career as it will likely bore you to tears. &nbsp;Work
																instead in specialized areas	while incorporating SE's valuable components a la carte.
