My name is Chris Everett, former quarterback of the New Orleans Saints and Purdue University.  After constant harassment by Jim Rome and the San Fransisco 49'ers DEEFense Tim, I've decided to be strong and embrace my new name.  I know this has STUNNED every one of my fans; moreso than University of Georgia's (UGA's) defense was when Vandy took the lead.  Since retiring from the NFL in 1997, I have moved on to complete my Masters of Business Administration (MBA) at Pepperdine University.  In my spare time I research topics in reverse engineering, binary analysis, and machine learning.  Instead of dominating the NFL via Super Bowl performances, I have decided to apply big data analytics, visualization, and machine learning concepts to dominate a different kind of league: Yahoo Fantasy Football.
